# Explaining the other codes:
## comparing_gaussianbeam_characterization
This code reads multiple folders for each laser. (In here it is the 375, 397, and 422nm lasers)
Then, is able to ge the waist of the beam at the loaction that each image was taken then plot it onto the plot for all the folders.
(This one being three diffrent folders for the 3 lasers)
*Store folders in the same location as the code


## gaussianbeam_characterization


# beam_curve_fit
This code is can do beam curve fitting with an image of the beam. 
supported_formats = ['.tif', '.tiff', '.pgm', '.ppm']
